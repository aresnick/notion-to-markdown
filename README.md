This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/index.html](http://localhost:3000/index.html) with your browser to see a basic page which requires you enter:
* A page URL
* Your Notion API Key/Secret

**Note that your Notion Integration needs to be explicitly granted access to the page (or a parent page), even if the page is public**
